        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>I was introduced to coding in middle school and fell in love instantly, 
            however I didn't think coding was for me and never took the interest seriously</p>

        <p>When I became a teacher programming was on the syllabus and I began teaching 
            programming on an elementary level and my basic understanding was enough for this. Moreover,
            my curiosity grew and I couldn't let go of my ambitions to learn how to code
        </p>

        <p>In the fall of 2021 I became a parent for the second time. While on maternity leave I needed something
            to satisfy my own development and I signed up for a free 3 day workshop <span class="tjejer"> Tjejer kodar</span>. 
            I was so excited by this course that I decided to further develop my skills. I was thrilled when accepted to the course
            "Tech for Women" at Sundsgården.
        </p>

        <h2>Tech for Women</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Sass</li>
            <li>Modern libraries</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Over the course of a five month period the course Tech for Women covers
            everything from the importance of marketing yourself on social media to animations in CSS.
            The course has taken me from very basic knowledge to a point where
            I can now code a web site, style it, market it and upload my files to github 
            and other servers to make it live. I'm now ready for my first job as a front-end developer!
